# Hi! 

This will be the repo where I store my dotfiles. Right now, I'm pretty much a newb at everything Linux. This will change at some point. GLHF.

An install.sh bash script is included to place softlinks to the dotfiles in their expected locations. This install script and the included dotfiles are subject to change, so make sure to check the install.sh script for what is put where. Drop an Issue if you have any suggestions.

Todo:
- [ ] Check for existing dirs and files with install.sh
- [ ] Make Hyprland config more extensible by creating multiple files for each section
- [ ] Include wallpapers and allow for automatic cycling based on time of day
- [ ] Include bash script to automatically dim screen brightness based on time of day
- [ ] Fix waybar to make workspace buttons more useful (stole the current layout and I really dislike it)
